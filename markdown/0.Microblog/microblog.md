Happy new year!

During winter break, I worked on a new project using my 3d printer. I attached a small keybaord to a Raspberry Pi 4 and 7.9" waveshare screen to create a tiny linux terminal. It is easy to cary around, energy efficeint, and powerful enough for working on papers, taking notes, and editing my webpage.

I have added an updated working paper [Subgame Perfect Coalition Formation](https://gregcleo.com/2.Working_Papers/SPGS.html) (joint with Eugene Vorobeychik and Myrna Wooders).

In this paper, we analyze a dynamic coalition formation game, the "seqeuential proposer game". A player proposes a coalition. The players in that coalition accpet or reject the proposal. As long as each player is able to make enough proposals, the equilibrium outcome is Pareto optimal.
