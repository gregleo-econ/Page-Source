I’ve moved my site generation to a new raspberry **pi zero 2**. Test.

Previously, this site was generated in the cloud via a GitHub action. This required GitHub to fire up a virtual machine each time I updated my site. To speed up this process and expand my control over the generation, I’ve migrated this to $15 pi zero. The time from updating my source repo to having live html updates is down to about a minute, and now I can incorporated more complex build workflows using other tools.

ChiWriter is a document editor for MsDos with built-in math fonts written by Cay Horstmann in 1986. It is available as abandonware on [Cay Hortsmann's Website.](https://horstmann.com/ChiWriter/)

The look of ChiWriter inspried the theme of this page. So blue...

I have added an updated working paper [Subgame Perfect Coalition Formation](https://gregcleo.com/2.%20Working%20Papers/SPGS.html) (joint with Eugene Vorobeychik and Myrna Wooders).

In this paper, we analyze a dynamic coalition formation game, the "seqeuential proposer game". A player proposes a coalition. The players in that coalition accpet or reject the proposal. As long as each player is able to make enough proposals, the equilibrium outcome is Pareto optimal.

This page now builds automatically using github actions! This lets me update the page and add content from *anywhere*. In fact, I posted this update from my [Pocket C.H.I.P](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/pocketchip-or-pi).
