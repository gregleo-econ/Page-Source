ChiWriter is a document editor for MsDos with built-in math fonts written by Cay Horstmann in 1986. It is available as abandonware on [Cay Hortsmann's Website.](https://horstmann.com/ChiWriter/) 

The look of ChiWriter inspried the theme of this page. So blue...

I have added an updated working paper [Subgame Perfect Coalition Formation](https://gregcleo.com/2.%20Working%20Papers/SPGS.html) (joint with Eugene Vorobeychik and Myrna Wooders).

In this paper, we analyze a dynamic coalition formation game, the "seqeuential proposer game". A player proposes a coalition. The players in that coalition accpet or reject the proposal. As long as each player is able to make enough proposals, the equilibrium outcome is Pareto optimal.
