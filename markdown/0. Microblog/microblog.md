I am on gopherspace at [gopher://gopher.gregcleo.com:70/](gopher://gopher.gregcleo.com:70/).

## What is Gopher?

The [Gopher Protocol](https://mncomputinghistory.com/gopher-protocol/) is an alternative to HTTP that was created in 1991 at the University of Minnesota. It is a very simple protocol for the distribution of (primarily) text. Gopher has had a resurgence recently thanks to the "Small Internet" movement that aims to get away from the bloat and noise of the modern internet.

## How do I View Gopehrspace?!?

You have a few options. If you have Linux, you can use the Lynx browser, which supports both gopher and http. On Windows or Mac, you can look for a native gopher client, or use the Firefox add-on client called ["Overbite"](https://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/). If you do not want to download a client, you can also use the [Floodgap Public Gopher Proxy](https://gopher.floodgap.com), which allows you to view the Gopherspace through your http browser.

## Why?

I remember Gopher vaguely from my childhood, so there is an element of nostalgia. I also really like working in and consuming plain text.

ChiWriter is a document editor for MsDos with built-in math fonts written by Cay Horstmann in 1986. It is available as abandonware on [Cay Hortsmann's Website.](https://horstmann.com/ChiWriter/)

The look of ChiWriter inspried the theme of this page. So blue...

I have added an updated working paper [Subgame Perfect Coalition Formation](https://gregcleo.com/2.%20Working%20Papers/SPGS.html) (joint with Eugene Vorobeychik and Myrna Wooders).

In this paper, we analyze a dynamic coalition formation game, the "seqeuential proposer game". A player proposes a coalition. The players in that coalition accpet or reject the proposal. As long as each player is able to make enough proposals, the equilibrium outcome is Pareto optimal.

I will be presenting "Minimal Experiments" (joint with PJ Healy) on 10/4/21 at The University of Tennessee.

This page now builds automatically using github actions! This lets me update the page and add content from *anywhere*. In fact, I posted this update from my [Pocket C.H.I.P](https://opensource.com/article/17/2/pocketchip-or-pi).
