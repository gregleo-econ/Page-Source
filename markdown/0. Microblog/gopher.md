## What is Gopher?

The [Gopher Protocol](https://mncomputinghistory.com/gopher-protocol/) is an alternative to HTTP that was created in 1991 at the University of Minnesota. It is a very simple protocol for the distribution of (primarily) text-only content. Gopher has had a resurgence together thanks to the "Small Internet" movement.
