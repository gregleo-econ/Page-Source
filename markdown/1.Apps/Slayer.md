# Word Slayer (R Shiny Word Game)

This is a game I wrote for my wife's birthday. It is a *wordlelike* inspired by retro dungeon-crawler games. In each level of the dungeon, you have 5 turns to try to figure out the word. Your turns roll over to the next level, but the words also get longer (up to 10 letters). Can you get all the way through level 10??
