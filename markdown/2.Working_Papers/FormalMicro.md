## About

This is a project to formalize the foundations of microeconomic theory in the [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) theorem prover. 

## What is Lean?

[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) is a programming language that implements a variation of dependent type theory. Lean has been used to formalize and validate a [huge variety of mathematics](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html).

A Lean proof looks very little like a normal "paper" proof. For instace, here is our proof of *Proposition 1.9 f* from Kreps' *Microeconomic Foundations I*. 

If $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$ then $x \sim z$.
