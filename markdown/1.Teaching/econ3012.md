## Notes

These notes are less detailed than the textbook, but cover all of the same key topics. They are a polished version of the notes created during my Fall 2022 lectures.

[Edited Class Notes (Small Screen Version)](../files/3010/3012_Notes_Small.pdf)  

These are the **unedited** notes written during class. These may be hard to follow without the accompanying lecture. I do not reccomend reading these notes if you missed class. Use the edited notes above. They may be useful to reference the mathematics of examples we have worked through.

## Intro

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This course focuses on the formal analysis of the behavior of individuals and firms and how these behaviors aggregate in a market. We will analyze market performance and determine how performance is influenced by various changes. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. *Please check it on a regular basis*.

## Mathematical Level

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytic reasoning. A review of the relevant mathematical concepts will occur on the first day of class.

## Textbook(s)

**Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach** by Hal R. Varian. **Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics** (Ninth Edition), by Theodore C. Bergstrom and Hal R. Varian.  

To make sure the problems in your book match the problems assigned in the problem sets, *please try to get the latest version of the workout book.* 


## Problem Sets

Problem sets will consist of selections from problems in the workouts book, as well as problems I have written. The problem sets will be posted on this page in the schedule below. I encourage working on the homework in groups. The homework will be graded by the teaching assistant.

## Exams and Grading

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below. Grading will be based 30% on midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.
