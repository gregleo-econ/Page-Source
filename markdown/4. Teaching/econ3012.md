# Econ 3012

## Intro

This is the course website for Vanderbilt Economics 3012. This course focuses on the formal analysis of the behavior of individuals and firms and how these behaviors aggregate in a market. We will analyze market performance and determine how performance is influenced by various changes. This page will be continuously updated throughout the semester. Please check it on a regular basis. Consider subscribing to changes using a service such as [Visual Ping](visualping.io) or [Wachete](wachete.com).


## Mathematical Level 

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytical reasoning. A review of the relevant mathematical concepts will occur on the first day of class.


## Textbook(s)

**Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach** by Hal R. Varian.
**Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics** (Ninth Edition), by Theodore C. Bergstrom and Hal R. Varian.


## Problem Sets 

Problem sets will consist of selections from problems in the “Workouts” book, as well as problems written by the instructor. The problem sets will be posted on this page in the schedule below. I encourage working on the homework in groups. The homework will be graded by the teaching assistant, and reviewed by the instructor.


## Exams and Grading 

There will be one midterm and a final exam. They are tentatively placed in the schedule below.  Grading will be based 30% on midterm exam, 50% on the final exam, and 20% on homework.
