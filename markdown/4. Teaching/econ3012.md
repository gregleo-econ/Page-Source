## Mathematical Level

Some concepts and formulas from differential calculus will be used, but most of the presentations, homework and exams will involve diagrams, algebra and analytic reasoning. A review of the relevant mathematical concepts will occur on the first day of class.

## Textbook(s)

**Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus: A Modern Approach** by Hal R. Varian. **Workouts in Intermediate Microeconomics** (Ninth Edition), by Theodore C. Bergstrom and Hal R. Varian.

## Problem Sets

Problem sets will consist of selections from problems in the workouts book, as well as problems I have written. The problem sets will be posted on this page in the schedule below. I encourage working on the homework in groups. The homework will be graded by the teaching assistant.
